# Mega Man: The Ultimate Wily Wars
A fan update to Mega Man: The Wily Wars for the Sega Genesis. Just like the original, *Mega Man: The Ultimate Wily Wars* will include a story based on Dr. Wily dealing with time travel and trying to end Mega Man, as per usual. The game plans to bridge across all ten of the main series titles, while retaining a consistent 8-bit style, just like the first 6 *Mega Man* titles.

# Details
 - 3 playable characters, being Mega Man, Proto Man, and Bass, each with their own reasons to deal with Wily.
 - Consistent mechanics across each 'game' (Mega Man's slide, Proto Man's shield, Rush and Treble being mobility accessories)
 - Boss Rush mode, where the player goes through fighting each of the Fortress Bosses, Robot Masters, or Wily Machines.
 - Sprite Gallery, where the player can cycle through assets used in the game, with details on enemies and Special Weapons
 - Sound Test, where the player can play the game's music to their heart's content!
 - Randomizer Mode, where the player plays through the main story, but time got a bit, confused, I guess? So the Robot Masters got displaced, and you can now do things like fight Concrete Man (from *Mega Man 9*) in Bomb Man's stage (from *Mega Man*)! There might be a special cutscene with wormholes and stuff of the sort.
 - 4 difficulty modes: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Extreme
  - Easy Mode: Essentially just like a normal *Mega Man* title, but with less knockback.
  - Normal Mode: Exactly like a normal *Mega Man* game. Nothing missing, nothing extra.
  - Hard Mode: Enemies have twice the health! Have fun with that...
  - Extreme Mode: Just like Hard Mode, but now **weapons take twice the energy.** Only for the elite!
